## Overview

The Transformer model, as introduced by Vaswani et al. in "Attention is All You Need", has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). This project provides an end-to-end implementation of a Transformer for machine translation, demonstrating how to build and train the model from scratch using PyTorch.

## Features

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Captures relationships between all words in a sequence, regardless of their position.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Enhances the modelâ€™s ability to focus on different parts of the input.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of each word in the sequence.
- **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Ensures stable and efficient training.
